<h1>About Us:</h1>
<p><strong>Stormcrow Drone Services</strong> is a Harrisburg-based company that specializes in <a href="real_estate.html" style="text-decoration: none;">real estate</a> photography and videography.</p>
<p>There is no project too big or too small that the Stormcrow team would not eagerly take on. We offer year-round services with as many rain-dates as needed. Although we are located in the Harrisburg, we are willing to travel to you!</p><br><br>
<h2>Our pilot: Nick Pachella</h2>
<p>Nick graduated from West Chester University in May 2017 with a bachelors degree in physics. He began flying in June 2017 with his very first drone: <a href="https://www.rotorcopters.com/wp-content/uploads/Holy-Stone-X400C-9F.jpg" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Holy Stone X400C</a>. After his first lift-off the leightweight drone made a B-line for the neighbors tallest tree, and there it remains, as a reminder to always read the user manual.</p>
<p>Many hours of practice later, Nick upgraded to his current model: <a href="https://www.dji.com/mavic-air" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">DJI Mavic Air</a>. Nick says, “If this drone were any smarter, it would do your taxes for you!”</p><br><br>
<h2>Safety:</h2>
<p>Nick is FAA-certified and insured for up to $10 million.</p>
<p>Our number one goal is and always will be safety. We ensure that weather conditions are ideal for both flight and photography/videography. Should a session be cancelled due to inclement weather, we can reschedule as many times as necessary to complete the project.</p>
